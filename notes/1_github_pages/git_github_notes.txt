Git: version control software
    Version control software allows us to save and restore versions of our files at various points.

GitHub: "is a developer platform that allows developers to create, store, manage, and share their code... providing the distributed version control of Git"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Commands:
- git status: to check current status of repository

- git add FILE_NAME: to add file to list of items needed to be committed

- git commit -m "message_here": to commit your new file 
    - must have a message associated with it

- vi: text editor you can access from a unix shell
    - i: insert (to insert text)
    - esc: to get out of insert
    - :wq => to write then quit vi 
    - :q => to quit vi

- git push origin main: push committed files to github 
    - git push also works

- git diff FILE_NAME: will show you the changes/differences in Github and git for a file

- git pull: will pull changes from the remote (github server) to your local repository

- .gitignore: specifies all files, directories, and file patterns that git should not track the changes of 
    - hidden file 

    # add a file: specify path to the file
    #   example: if settings folder in directory, -> settings/settings.txt would be listed

Merge Conflicts:

- branch: a pointer/reference to a single commit
    - timeline of changes (can have multiple branches with each having different changes in them)
    - changes from one branch can be brought into another branch with merges

- merge conflicts 

- repository forks: new repository that shares code and visibility settings with the original "upstream" repository
    - used to iterate an idea or changes before they are proposed back to the upstream repository
    - usually in open source projects or when a user doesn't have access to the upstream repository
